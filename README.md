## About Me

I'm passionate about crafting and maintaining software that has a positive impact on people's lives.

ðŸ—»  I love learning languages and am actively studying for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test N2 (Advanced) this December. \
ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently developing a web application for Japanese language learners. \
ðŸŒ±  A hobby project that I'm currently working on is building a 6502 microprocessor-based breadboard computer.
