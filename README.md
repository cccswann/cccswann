## About Me

I'm passionate about learning; nothing beats the feeling of gaining insight on concepts that I originally found challenging or complex. I'm continuously striving to craft and maintain software that benefits others.

🗻  I love learning languages and am actively studying for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test N2 (Advanced) this December. \
⚡  A hobby project that I'm currently working on is building a 6502 microprocessor-based breadboard computer. \
⌨️  I build custom keyboards in my free time.
